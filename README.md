# surfmap_server
A SOAP interface for the surfmapper project

Surfmapper is a project designed to keep track of browsing history and visualize it in a node graph. 
This is a server, which is written in Perl, that serves SOAP requests and interacts with the storage system. 
I have no plans to describe any installation procedures in the near future.
